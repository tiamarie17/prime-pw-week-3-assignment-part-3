    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->

    <ol>
      <li>When creating a for of loop, are there specific rules for naming the first word inside the parentheses or can you choose any word?
        Ex: for (list of stars) {console.log(list);} where stars is the array, is the word 'list' correctly used? It runs fine in console, but conceptually I
        don't think I'm fully understanding what's happening there. In other words, is the 'list' word really representing the list of items in the array?</li>
    </ol>
